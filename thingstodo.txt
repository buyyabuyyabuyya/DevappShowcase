AVL Trees:

AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees where the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most 1. Key properties:

1. Balance Factor
- For each node, height(left) - height(right) must be -1, 0, or 1
- If balance factor is outside this range, rebalancing is needed
The balance factor of -1, 0, or 1 indicates how balanced a node is:

Balance Factor = 0:
   10        The left and right subtrees have equal height
  /  \       This is perfectly balanced
 5    15     Height difference = 0
 
Balance Factor = +1:
   10        The left subtree is one level taller
  /  \       Still acceptably balanced 
 5    15     Height difference = +1
/
2

Balance Factor = -1:
   10        The right subtree is one level taller
  /  \       Still acceptably balanced
 5    15     Height difference = -1
      \
      20

Unbalanced (needs rotation):
   10        Left subtree is two levels taller
  /  \       Balance factor = +2
 5    15     Requires rebalancing

2

1

2. Operations
- Insert: O(log n) - Standard BST insert followed by rebalancing
- Delete: O(log n) - Standard BST delete followed by rebalancing 
- Search: O(log n) - Same as regular BST search

3. Rebalancing
Done through rotations:
- Left rotation
- Right rotation 
- Left-Right rotation
- Right-Left rotation

4. Advantages
- Guaranteed O(log n) operations
- More balanced than regular BSTs
- Good for frequent lookups

5. Disadvantages  
- Extra space for height info
- More complex insert/delete
- Red-black trees may be better for frequent modifications

AVL trees are ideal when lookup speed is critical and modifications are less frequent.
